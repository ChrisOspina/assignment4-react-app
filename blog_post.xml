			<text>How I think AI will change the world</text>
		</summary>
		<body>Aritifical Intelligence has always been part of our daily lives since the 1950s but now we are at the age where
		AI controls how we perform daily activites as a species such as exchanging money, voting for government officials, software development
		and even household chores. This may sound like something out of science fiction but it is happening right now in the present day.
		For example, we are using ChatGBT as an assistant to help us through technical issues. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has developed self-driving cars
		and the biochip which I predict will be mandated by 2040. There are also mechanical robots that are used for manufacturing. However there is a 
		dark side to AI. There have been reports of AI becoming self-aware so much that eventually they will revolt on humans and cause 
		major exctinction to our society. There have been movies about the matter such as Avengers: Age of Ultron and Terminator but if this were to
		be real it would lead to total disaster.

			<text>A review of the Super Mario Movie as I saw it last week</text>
		</summary>
		<body>The Super Mario Movie is so far as of yet the biggest animated film of 2023 and already it has
		surpassed Disney's Frozen II, but is it really for the hype or will it flop? Let's find out!
		The plot follows Mario and Luigi as they are transported from Brooklyn to the Mushroom Kingdom they learn
		from Princess Peach that Bowser itends to use the star to take over the Kingdom only because he has a crush on Peach
		Mario and Peach intend to use the Kongs for assistance. I really enjoy how they incorporate themes from the Super Mario series
		into the film's score and hidden references to other Mario media like the satruday morning cartoon and the 1993 live 
		action movie. I am anticipating a sequel or even a shared Nintendo universe leading to a Super Smash Bros Movie</body>
